# Date Logic (Calendar vs Pay Period vs Fiscal)

This is the #2 source of mismatch.

## Calendar date
Use when:
- month-to-date / year-to-date by calendar month
- operational daily trend dashboards

## Pay period
Use when:
- payroll-aligned reporting
- comparing to payroll registers and pay summaries

## Fiscal period
Use when:
- leadership expects fiscal months/quarters
- budgeting and finance reporting use a fiscal calendar

## Best practice
Every KPI/report must explicitly state:
- which “time system” it uses (calendar/pay period/fiscal)
- which dates are used for grouping (work date vs approval date vs posted date)
- how time zones are handled (if applicable)
