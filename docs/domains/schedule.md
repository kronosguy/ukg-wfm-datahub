# Schedule

## What it contains
Planned shifts/segments and coverage intent.

## Why it matters
Schedule is the plan. Timecard is reality. Variance is insight.

## Best practices
- Use schedule summary for KPIs
- Use schedule detail for coverage analysis
- Avoid schedule-detail ↔ timecard-detail joins without grain control
