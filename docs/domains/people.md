# People

## What it contains
Employee identity and workforce attributes (job/role, employment status, supervisor relationships).

## Why it matters
People attributes are how leadership wants results sliced (by job, supervisor, status).

## Best practices
- Join on person IDs (not names)
- Treat names/emails as display-only
- Watch out for “current attributes” applied to historical facts
