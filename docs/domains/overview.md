# Domains Overview

Domains are the way this repo organizes Data Hub subject areas.

Use this flow:
1) pick the domain (Timecard vs Schedule vs Accruals, etc.)
2) pick summary vs detail
3) pick grain
4) apply filters
5) validate

This repo stays public-safe, so domain pages focus on:
- what the domain generally contains
- why it matters
- how to report on it safely
- common gotchas
