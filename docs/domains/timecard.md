# Timecard

## What it contains
Worked reality: punches/events and interpreted work segments.

## Why it matters
Timecard data explains what actually happened (hours, exceptions, edits).

## Best practices
- Dashboards: start with summary/totals if available
- Investigations: use detail, tightly bounded by date
- Always validate grain before joining to schedule detail
