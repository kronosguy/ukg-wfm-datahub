# Contributing

This repo is public-safe by design. Do not add tenant-specific identifiers, internal URLs, or PII.

## What to contribute
- Use Case pages (golden paths)
- Domain expansions (gotchas, safe join patterns)
- Validation checklists
- KPI contracts and report specs

## Minimum standard for new pages
Every page should include:
- purpose
- grain
- filters (cost-safe)
- validation checklist
- gotchas

## Style
- be concrete
- avoid internal acronyms without defining them
- prefer examples that are public-safe
